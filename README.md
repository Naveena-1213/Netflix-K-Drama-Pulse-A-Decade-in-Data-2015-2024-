# Netflix-K-Drama-Pulse-A-Decade-in-Data-2015-2024

## Background and Overview
The global rise of K-Dramas has been phenomenal over the past decade, with Netflix playing a major role in taking these series beyond South Korea to audiences worldwide.

This project, "K-Drama Pulse: A Decade in Data (2015â€“2024)", analyzes the trends, performance, and audience reception of K-Dramas on Netflix from 2015 to 2024. By leveraging data extracted from TMDB using Python, we explore how the number of dramas, genres, actors, and ratings have evolved over time.

The main goal is to provide actionable insights for content strategists, producers, and marketers, helping them understand viewer preferences and make data-driven decisions for future programming.
